PRESERVATION`OCCULT PHILOSOPHY`ALCHEMY`UTILITY`0`Requirement: You must have an alchemist’s kit. Target: One Size 1 or smaller object you can reach. Duration: 10 days. You whip up a special ointment from your alchemist’s kit and smear it on the target. For the duration, the target will not rot, decay, or spoil. The target takes half damage from all sources. If the target is something that can be worn, the protective quality applies to the object and not the wearer— smearing the substance on a suit of plate and mail armor would impart all the qualities to the armor, but the wearer would still take damage as normal. If you smear the substance on a clockwork in object form, the clockwork remains protected by the spell until it returns to its creature form or until the spell ends. Finally, if the target is a corpse, the magic prevents it from being turned into undead.`
VENOMOUS DART`OCCULT PHILOSOPHY`ALCHEMY`UTILITY`0`Requirement: You must have an alchemist’s kit and at least one dart. Duration: Until you complete a rest. Upon casting this spell, you must concentrate for 1 minute, during which time you use your alchemist’s kit to concoct a special poison and apply it to as many as five darts.

When you finish, you fill each container with the substance, which retains potency for the duration or until the bottle is used. A creature holding the container can use an action to throw it at a point within short range. If the point is on a creature, the thrower must get a success on an Agility attack roll against the creature’s Agility. Otherwise, the bottle lands at a point within 1d3 yards of the creature in a direction of the GM’s choosing. When the bottle strikes a solid surface, the container breaks and the substance inside explodes in a 2-yard radius centered on the point of impact. The flames from the explosion deal 1d6 damage to everything in that area. Combustible objects that take this damage catch fire. A creature in the area of the explosion must make an Agility challenge roll, taking half the damage on a success, or catching fire on a failure. A creature that catches fire takes 1d6 damage from the flames at the end of each round until the fire is extinguished.`

Otherwise, the bead lands at a point within 1d3 yards of the creature in a direction the GM chooses. When the bead strikes a solid surface, it shatters, and the liquid inside becomes a foul-smelling fog that spreads out in a 5-yard radius centered on that point. The fog remains for the duration. It partially obscures the area, and any living, breathing creature in the area when it appears or that enters that area must make a Strength challenge roll with 1 bane. On a failure, the creature becomes impaired for as long as it remains in the fog and for 1 minute after. On a success, the creature becomes immune to the effects of the fog.

When you cast the spell and again whenever you use an action to do so, you can make an attack with an unarmed strike, substituting Intellect for the attribute you ordinarily use to make attacks with unarmed strikes. If you get a success against a creature or against an object made from organic materials such as wood, bone, or flesh, the target of the attack takes 2d6 extra damage from the corrosive substance on your hand.`
OIL SLICK`OCCULT PHILOSOPHY`ALCHEMY`ATTACK`2`Area: A circle with a 5-yard radius centered on a point on the ground within short range. Duration: 10 minutes.

Once per round when a creature moves across a surface in the area by a means other than crawling or tries to stand up in it, the creature must get a success on an Agility challenge roll with 3 banes or fall prone. Any creature that tries to pick up an object from out of the oil must get a success on an Agility challenge roll with 3 banes.

If anything in the area takes fire damage, the entire area catches fire and burns for 1d6 minutes, filling the air with acrid smoke. The smoke heavily obscures the area, and any creature in the area that breathes it must get a success on a Strength challenge roll or take 1d6 damage.

MANIKINS`OCCULT PHILOSOPHY`ALCHEMY`UTILITY`3`Requirement: You must have an alchemist’s kit. Target: A Size 1 block of clay. Duration: See the effect. Upon casting this spell, you must concentrate for up to 5 minutes. For each minute you spend in concentration, you shape one compelled tiny construct (see page 136) from the target.

While at least one construct remains, you can use an action to perceive from the space of any active construct that is within long range. When you perceive from the construct’s space, you are blinded and deafened with respect to the space you occupy, but you can see and hear normally from the construct’s space. You can use a triggered action at any time to end this effect. Sacrifice: You can use an action and expend a casting of this spell to cause each manikin created by this spell to explode in a 1-yard radius centered on a point within the manikin’s space.

If the thrower chooses a point on a creature, the thrower must get a success on an Agility attack roll against the creature’s Agility. The bottle hits the creature on a success; on a failure, it lands within 1d3 yards of the specified point in a direction the GM chooses. Upon striking a solid surface, the container breaks, releasing fiery goo that threatens to cover everything in a 4-yard radius hemisphere. A creature that gets a success on an Agility challenge roll avoids the goo. Anything covered in the dragon fire takes 2d6 damage and catches fire. A creature that catches fire takes 1d6 damage from the flames at the end of each round until the fire is extinguished. The flames from the substance last 1 minute, cannot be smothered by ordinary means, and burn even when submerged in liquid. A creature can use an action to scrape away the goo with an object, which then catches fire if it is flammable. Once dragon fire burns out, it leaves behind ordinary fire that can be extinguished using normal means.`

Any living creature holding a syringe that contains the substance can use an action to voluntarily inject the substance into itself or into another willing and living creature. Against an unwilling living creature, the creature holding the syringe must get a success on an Agility attack roll against the target’s Agility. If the substance is inside a bottle, a living creature holding it can use an action to consume it or to administer it to a defenseless or unconscious living creature.

CHROMATIC LANCE`OCCULT PHILOSOPHY`CHAOS`ATTACK`2`Target: One creature within medium range. A braided rainbow leaps from your hand. Make a Will attack roll against the target’s Agility.

On a 4 or higher, the target takes double damage from all sources for 1d6 rounds thereafter.`
CHAOS UNLEASHED`OCCULT PHILOSOPHY`CHAOS`UTILITY`2`Area: A 5-yard-radius sphere centered on a point you can reach. Duration: 1 minute. A buzzing cloud of sparkling lights spreads through the area and remains for the duration. The cloud grants 2 boons to attack rolls made by creatures in the area when they cast attack spells and imposes 2 banes on challenge rolls made by creatures outside the area to resist attack spells cast from within the area. When a creature in the area casts any spell, however, it must get a success on a Will challenge roll or take 1d6 damage from exposure to the chaotic energy.`
CHAOS ORB`OCCULT PHILOSOPHY`CHAOS`ATTACK`3`Target: A point you can see on a solid surface within medium range. You gather up and throw a ball of unruly, chaotic energy at the target. When the ball reaches its destination or if it encounters a solid surface before then, it explodes into a 3-yard-radius sphere centered on the point it struck. The energy deals 3d6 damage to everything in the area. A creature in the area can make an Agility challenge roll and takes half the damage on a success. Then, roll a d6. On an odd number, the spell ends. On an even number, the ball bounces 1d6 yards. Roll a d6: you choose the direction on an even number, and the GM chooses a direction on an odd number. When the ball lands at the new point, it releases a pulse as described above. A creature can take damage from this spell only once per round per casting of the spell, regardless of how many times it finds itself in the area of its pulse. Roll a d6 again to determine if the ball continues bouncing or the spell ends. Continue this process until the spell ends.`
SCINTILLATING WORMS`OCCULT PHILOSOPHY`CHAOS`ATTACK`3`Target: Up to three creatures within medium range. You fling out your hand to release one writhing, scintillating tendril toward each of the targets. For each tendril, make a Will attack roll against the target’s Agility. On a failure, the tendril dissipates. On a success, the tendril touches the target, vanishes into it, and causes light to shine out from the target’s eyes and orifices in a 10-yard radius for 1 minute. The light grants 1 boon on attack rolls made against an affected target. When a target emitting light in this way would take a turn, roll a d6 and consult the following table to see what the target does. 1: The target cannot use an action or move. Instead, it experiences maddening revelations and gains 1d3 Insanity. 2: The target becomes immobilized for 1 round, during which time it floats 1d6 yards in the air. When the effect ends, the target falls to the ground. 3: The target can act normally, but it makes attack rolls and challenge rolls with 1 bane. 4: The light shining from the target causes it to catch fire. The target takes 1d6 damage at the end of each round until a creature uses an action to extinguish the flames. The target can act normally. 5: The target teleports to an open space of its choice within short range and then can act normally. 6: The target can act normally. It makes attack rolls and challenge rolls with 3 boons until the end of its turn.`

Each object in it that is not worn or carried by a creature warps, twists, and changes color. The object’s functionality is unchanged, however. Each creature in the area must make a Will challenge roll with 1 bane. A creature gains 1 Insanity on a failure, or on a success becomes subject to a random change. Roll a d6 for each creature that gets a success and consult the following table. 1: The creature becomes a monster (Shadow, page 246) of its Size and uses the statistics of its new form in place of its own. The effect lasts until the target becomes injured or incapacitated, or until you complete a rest. 2: The creature gains the horrifying trait for 1 minute. 3: The creature’s Size increases by 1d6 for 1 minute. If there is not sufficient space for a creature of its new Size, the target takes 5d6 damage and the effect ends immediately. 4: The creature’s Size, but nothing it wears or carries, becomes 1/2 for 1 minute. 5: The creature teleports to an open space of your choosing within 1 mile of you. 6: The creature gains a +20 bonus to its Health and makes all attack rolls and challenge rolls with 1 boon.

UNCHAINED PROBABILITIES`OCCULT PHILOSOPHY`CHAOS`UTILITY`4`Target: A 10-yard-radius sphere centered on a point you can reach. Duration: 1 minute. A wave of electric blue light spreads through the area and remains for the duration, periodically making odd musical noises and flashing lights, and turning darkness in the area into shadows. Until the effect ends, when a creature in the area would make an attack roll or a challenge roll, it must roll two additional d20s, and you roll a d6. If you roll an odd number, the triggering creature uses the lowest number rolled on any d20. If you roll an even number, the triggering creature uses the highest number rolled on any d20. Sacrifice: You can use an action and expend a casting of this spell to cast the wild magic spell (Shadow, page 121).`

Brightly glowing vapors and flashing lights spread through the area and swirl around to heavily obscure it. The vortex remains for the duration. Each time you use an action to concentrate on this spell, you can make a Will challenge roll and move it up to 5 yards across the ground on a success. On a failure, the GM moves the vortex up to 5 yards in any direction. Any creature with a Health score of 15 or lower in the vortex’s space when it appears or that enters it dies, and its body along with everything it wears and carries, except for relics, breaks apart into colorful clouds that join the vortex. Relics fall to the ground in the vortex’s space, unharmed. Creatures with Health scores higher than 15 in the vortex’s space when it appears or that enter it must make a Will challenge roll. A creature takes 4d6 damage from the wild energy on a failure, or half the damage on a success. A creature can take this damage only once per round per casting of the spell, regardless of how many times it enters the vortex’s space during that round. Finally, whenever a creature within medium range of the vortex casts a spell, roll a d6 and consult the following table. 1: A pulse of energy spreads 1d6 yards out from the vortex and dissipates. Everything in the area of the pulse and outside the space of the vortex must get a success on an Agility challenge roll or take 2d6 damage. 2: The vortex moves 1d6 yards toward the triggering creature. 3: Nothing happens. 4: The vortex moves 1d6 yards away from the triggering creature. 5: The vortex adds 1d3 yards to its radius. 6: A pulse of energy spreads 2d6 yards out from the vortex and dissipates.

On a 2, nothing else happens. On a 3, the target gains a +1d3 bonus to the score. A bonus cannot increase an attribute score above 20 or reduce it below 1. Bonuses and penalties last until the spell ends. They do not, however, modify the target’s characteristics.

The wall emits light out to a range of 20 yards. If you concentrate for the full minute, the wall remains for 1 additional hour without requiring your attention. Any object in the wall’s space that is not a relic takes damage equal to its Health and disappears. For any creature in the wall’s space when it appears or that enters it, roll a d6 and consult the following table. A creature can be affected by the wall only once per round per casting of this spell, regardless of how many times it enters the wall’s space. 1: Nothing happens. 2: The creature must make a Perception challenge roll with 1 bane.

The matter can take any shape you choose, though it cannot have moving parts.

CONJURE CONVEYANCE`OCCULT PHILOSOPHY`CONJURATION`UTILITY`5`Area: A cube of space, 10 yards on a side, originating from a point within medium range. Duration: 12 hours; see the effect. A vehicle appears on a solid or liquid surface inside the area. If you chose a solid surface, the vehicle is a carriage drawn by a team of four horses (Shadow, page 242). If you chose a liquid surface, the vehicle is a boat. The vehicle remains for the duration or until it’s destroyed, at which point the vehicle disappears in a cloud of sparkles. Either vehicle is a Size 6 object with Health 100, able to hold creatures and objects whose total Size does not exceed 20. Its maximum Speed is 20 (acceleration 4/deceleration 2) in combat or 30 miles per hour out of combat.

PASSAGE`OCCULT PHILOSOPHY`CONJURATION`UTILITY`5`Target: A point on a solid or liquid surface within long range. Duration: 1 hour. You open a space into the surface that contains the target.

SIMULACRUM`OCCULT PHILOSOPHY`CONJURATION`UTILITY`6`Requirement: You must have a silver mirror worth 1 gc. Area: A cube of space, large enough to accommodate a creature of your Size, originating from a point you can reach. Duration: See the effect. The mirror disappears, and a naked copy of yourself appears inside the area. Your consciousness moves into the copy’s body, where it remains until the body becomes incapacitated, which ends the spell and causes the copy to disappear into a cloud of sparkles. The copy’s body uses all your attributes and characteristics, except for its Health, which is half your normal Health score. The copy does not, however, start with any damage that your real body has. The copy can fully make use of any of your talents and traits and has full access to the spells you have learned. In effect, you create a second you (without, of course, your clothing and other possessions.) For as long as your consciousness occupies the copy’s body, your original body is unconscious. Provided you are within 1 mile of your original body, you can use an action to move your consciousness from your copy to your original body or vice versa. The body that your consciousness leaves becomes unconscious until you return to it. When your consciousness moves in this way, you become defenseless for 1 minute. When you transfer your consciousness, you leave behind any damage taken and marks of darkness gained by the body, but you bring with you Insanity, Corruption, and any remaining unexpended castings. If your consciousness occupies your copy’s body and the body dies, your consciousness travels back unerringly to your original body or the nearest other copy. Your disembodied consciousness travels at 10 miles per hour. It cannot use actions, does not perceive its surroundings, is immune to all damage and effects, and can move through solid objects. For each hour your consciousness remains outside a body, you gain 1 Insanity. If the gain would cause you to go mad, your consciousness shatters and never returns to the unconscious body. If your original body dies, the copy occupied by your consciousness becomes your new, permanent body. You are impaired while your consciousness occupies a copy of your body and is within short range of another copy of your body. When you finish casting the spell, you must get a success on a Will challenge roll with 3 banes or gain 1d3 Insanity. Sacrifice: You can use an action and expend a casting of this spell to allow your copy to heal all damage.`

Appearing inside the area are eight veterans (Shadow, page 262). They remain in existence for the duration. If a veteran conjured by this spell becomes incapacitated, it disappears. The veterans can have any appearance you choose. Friendly to you, they obey your spoken commands, even if doing so would be suicidal. On your turn, you can use a triggered action to briefly perceive from the space occupied by a veteran, provided you are within 1 mile of the creature. While you perceive from its space, you can issue it a command. Your senses return to your body when you finish your turn.`

The fortress is made of stone and consists of three turrets connected by three walls, creating a triangular space between them. Inside stands a keep, a stable, and a workshop. You decide the exact dimensions of the components of the structure, but no components can extend beyond the area. You can place as many doors and windows as you like throughout the structure and can divide the keep into as many floors and rooms as you wish. You can also designate a room’s function, which causes the room to become furnished appropriately for the function you assigned it. For example, a bedroom would have a bed, table, candles, and fireplace, while a dining hall would have tables and chairs. You can also add decorations and other cosmetic details. The fortress provides food and drink of whatever sort you wish enough to accommodate one hundred people. In addition, for every five creatures inside the fortress, the structure also creates a faceless servant (see page 136) that obeys your spoken commands or the spoken commands of any creature to which it is assigned. Aftereffect: Make a Strength challenge roll with 4 banes. On a success, you become fatigued until you complete a rest. If you’re already fatigued, take a –3d6 penalty to Health instead. On a failure, you take a penalty to your Health equal to half your Health that remains for 1 week and 1 day. If the total of your roll is 0 or lower, you take a penalty to your Health equal to your Health score and you die. Sacrifice: You can use an action and expend a casting of this spell to extend the duration by another 24 hours. Permanence: You must extend the spell’s duration each day for 1 year and 1 day.`

Aftereffect: Gain 1d6 Insanity, and then make a Strength challenge roll with 5 banes. On a failure, you take 10d6 damage. In addition, you take a –1d6 penalty to Power and become fatigued for 1 week and 1 day.
