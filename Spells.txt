PRESERVATION`OCCULT PHILOSOPHY`ALCHEMY`UTILITY`0`Requirement: You must have an alchemist’s kit. Target: One Size 1 or smaller object you can reach. Duration: 10 days. You whip up a special ointment from your alchemist’s kit and smear it on the target. For the duration, the target will not rot, decay, or spoil. The target takes half damage from all sources. If the target is something that can be worn, the protective quality applies to the object and not the wearer— smearing the substance on a suit of plate and mail armor would impart all the qualities to the armor, but the wearer would still take damage as normal. If you smear the substance on a clockwork in object form, the clockwork remains protected by the spell until it returns to its creature form or until the spell ends. Finally, if the target is a corpse, the magic prevents it from being turned into undead.`
VENOMOUS DART`OCCULT PHILOSOPHY`ALCHEMY`UTILITY`0`Requirement: You must have an alchemist’s kit and at least one dart. Duration: Until you complete a rest. Upon casting this spell, you must concentrate for 1 minute, during which time you use your alchemist’s kit to concoct a special poison and apply it to as many as five darts.

When you finish, you fill each container with the substance, which retains potency for the duration or until the bottle is used. A creature holding the container can use an action to throw it at a point within short range. If the point is on a creature, the thrower must get a success on an Agility attack roll against the creature’s Agility. Otherwise, the bottle lands at a point within 1d3 yards of the creature in a direction of the GM’s choosing. When the bottle strikes a solid surface, the container breaks and the substance inside explodes in a 2-yard radius centered on the point of impact. The flames from the explosion deal 1d6 damage to everything in that area. Combustible objects that take this damage catch fire. A creature in the area of the explosion must make an Agility challenge roll, taking half the damage on a success, or catching fire on a failure. A creature that catches fire takes 1d6 damage from the flames at the end of each round until the fire is extinguished.`

Otherwise, the bead lands at a point within 1d3 yards of the creature in a direction the GM chooses. When the bead strikes a solid surface, it shatters, and the liquid inside becomes a foul-smelling fog that spreads out in a 5-yard radius centered on that point. The fog remains for the duration. It partially obscures the area, and any living, breathing creature in the area when it appears or that enters that area must make a Strength challenge roll with 1 bane. On a failure, the creature becomes impaired for as long as it remains in the fog and for 1 minute after. On a success, the creature becomes immune to the effects of the fog.

When you cast the spell and again whenever you use an action to do so, you can make an attack with an unarmed strike, substituting Intellect for the attribute you ordinarily use to make attacks with unarmed strikes. If you get a success against a creature or against an object made from organic materials such as wood, bone, or flesh, the target of the attack takes 2d6 extra damage from the corrosive substance on your hand.`
OIL SLICK`OCCULT PHILOSOPHY`ALCHEMY`ATTACK`2`Area: A circle with a 5-yard radius centered on a point on the ground within short range. Duration: 10 minutes.

Once per round when a creature moves across a surface in the area by a means other than crawling or tries to stand up in it, the creature must get a success on an Agility challenge roll with 3 banes or fall prone. Any creature that tries to pick up an object from out of the oil must get a success on an Agility challenge roll with 3 banes.

If anything in the area takes fire damage, the entire area catches fire and burns for 1d6 minutes, filling the air with acrid smoke. The smoke heavily obscures the area, and any creature in the area that breathes it must get a success on a Strength challenge roll or take 1d6 damage.

MANIKINS`OCCULT PHILOSOPHY`ALCHEMY`UTILITY`3`Requirement: You must have an alchemist’s kit. Target: A Size 1 block of clay. Duration: See the effect. Upon casting this spell, you must concentrate for up to 5 minutes. For each minute you spend in concentration, you shape one compelled tiny construct (see page 136) from the target.

While at least one construct remains, you can use an action to perceive from the space of any active construct that is within long range. When you perceive from the construct’s space, you are blinded and deafened with respect to the space you occupy, but you can see and hear normally from the construct’s space. You can use a triggered action at any time to end this effect. Sacrifice: You can use an action and expend a casting of this spell to cause each manikin created by this spell to explode in a 1-yard radius centered on a point within the manikin’s space.

If the thrower chooses a point on a creature, the thrower must get a success on an Agility attack roll against the creature’s Agility. The bottle hits the creature on a success; on a failure, it lands within 1d3 yards of the specified point in a direction the GM chooses. Upon striking a solid surface, the container breaks, releasing fiery goo that threatens to cover everything in a 4-yard radius hemisphere. A creature that gets a success on an Agility challenge roll avoids the goo. Anything covered in the dragon fire takes 2d6 damage and catches fire. A creature that catches fire takes 1d6 damage from the flames at the end of each round until the fire is extinguished. The flames from the substance last 1 minute, cannot be smothered by ordinary means, and burn even when submerged in liquid. A creature can use an action to scrape away the goo with an object, which then catches fire if it is flammable. Once dragon fire burns out, it leaves behind ordinary fire that can be extinguished using normal means.`

Any living creature holding a syringe that contains the substance can use an action to voluntarily inject the substance into itself or into another willing and living creature. Against an unwilling living creature, the creature holding the syringe must get a success on an Agility attack roll against the target’s Agility. If the substance is inside a bottle, a living creature holding it can use an action to consume it or to administer it to a defenseless or unconscious living creature.

CHROMATIC LANCE`OCCULT PHILOSOPHY`CHAOS`ATTACK`2`Target: One creature within medium range. A braided rainbow leaps from your hand. Make a Will attack roll against the target’s Agility.

On a 4 or higher, the target takes double damage from all sources for 1d6 rounds thereafter.`
CHAOS UNLEASHED`OCCULT PHILOSOPHY`CHAOS`UTILITY`2`Area: A 5-yard-radius sphere centered on a point you can reach. Duration: 1 minute. A buzzing cloud of sparkling lights spreads through the area and remains for the duration. The cloud grants 2 boons to attack rolls made by creatures in the area when they cast attack spells and imposes 2 banes on challenge rolls made by creatures outside the area to resist attack spells cast from within the area. When a creature in the area casts any spell, however, it must get a success on a Will challenge roll or take 1d6 damage from exposure to the chaotic energy.`
CHAOS ORB`OCCULT PHILOSOPHY`CHAOS`ATTACK`3`Target: A point you can see on a solid surface within medium range. You gather up and throw a ball of unruly, chaotic energy at the target. When the ball reaches its destination or if it encounters a solid surface before then, it explodes into a 3-yard-radius sphere centered on the point it struck. The energy deals 3d6 damage to everything in the area. A creature in the area can make an Agility challenge roll and takes half the damage on a success. Then, roll a d6. On an odd number, the spell ends. On an even number, the ball bounces 1d6 yards. Roll a d6: you choose the direction on an even number, and the GM chooses a direction on an odd number. When the ball lands at the new point, it releases a pulse as described above. A creature can take damage from this spell only once per round per casting of the spell, regardless of how many times it finds itself in the area of its pulse. Roll a d6 again to determine if the ball continues bouncing or the spell ends. Continue this process until the spell ends.`
SCINTILLATING WORMS`OCCULT PHILOSOPHY`CHAOS`ATTACK`3`Target: Up to three creatures within medium range. You fling out your hand to release one writhing, scintillating tendril toward each of the targets. For each tendril, make a Will attack roll against the target’s Agility. On a failure, the tendril dissipates. On a success, the tendril touches the target, vanishes into it, and causes light to shine out from the target’s eyes and orifices in a 10-yard radius for 1 minute. The light grants 1 boon on attack rolls made against an affected target. When a target emitting light in this way would take a turn, roll a d6 and consult the following table to see what the target does. 1: The target cannot use an action or move. Instead, it experiences maddening revelations and gains 1d3 Insanity. 2: The target becomes immobilized for 1 round, during which time it floats 1d6 yards in the air. When the effect ends, the target falls to the ground. 3: The target can act normally, but it makes attack rolls and challenge rolls with 1 bane. 4: The light shining from the target causes it to catch fire. The target takes 1d6 damage at the end of each round until a creature uses an action to extinguish the flames. The target can act normally. 5: The target teleports to an open space of its choice within short range and then can act normally. 6: The target can act normally. It makes attack rolls and challenge rolls with 3 boons until the end of its turn.`

Each object in it that is not worn or carried by a creature warps, twists, and changes color. The object’s functionality is unchanged, however. Each creature in the area must make a Will challenge roll with 1 bane. A creature gains 1 Insanity on a failure, or on a success becomes subject to a random change. Roll a d6 for each creature that gets a success and consult the following table. 1: The creature becomes a monster (Shadow, page 246) of its Size and uses the statistics of its new form in place of its own. The effect lasts until the target becomes injured or incapacitated, or until you complete a rest. 2: The creature gains the horrifying trait for 1 minute. 3: The creature’s Size increases by 1d6 for 1 minute. If there is not sufficient space for a creature of its new Size, the target takes 5d6 damage and the effect ends immediately. 4: The creature’s Size, but nothing it wears or carries, becomes 1/2 for 1 minute. 5: The creature teleports to an open space of your choosing within 1 mile of you. 6: The creature gains a +20 bonus to its Health and makes all attack rolls and challenge rolls with 1 boon.

UNCHAINED PROBABILITIES`OCCULT PHILOSOPHY`CHAOS`UTILITY`4`Target: A 10-yard-radius sphere centered on a point you can reach. Duration: 1 minute. A wave of electric blue light spreads through the area and remains for the duration, periodically making odd musical noises and flashing lights, and turning darkness in the area into shadows. Until the effect ends, when a creature in the area would make an attack roll or a challenge roll, it must roll two additional d20s, and you roll a d6. If you roll an odd number, the triggering creature uses the lowest number rolled on any d20. If you roll an even number, the triggering creature uses the highest number rolled on any d20. Sacrifice: You can use an action and expend a casting of this spell to cast the wild magic spell (Shadow, page 121).`

Brightly glowing vapors and flashing lights spread through the area and swirl around to heavily obscure it. The vortex remains for the duration. Each time you use an action to concentrate on this spell, you can make a Will challenge roll and move it up to 5 yards across the ground on a success. On a failure, the GM moves the vortex up to 5 yards in any direction. Any creature with a Health score of 15 or lower in the vortex’s space when it appears or that enters it dies, and its body along with everything it wears and carries, except for relics, breaks apart into colorful clouds that join the vortex. Relics fall to the ground in the vortex’s space, unharmed. Creatures with Health scores higher than 15 in the vortex’s space when it appears or that enter it must make a Will challenge roll. A creature takes 4d6 damage from the wild energy on a failure, or half the damage on a success. A creature can take this damage only once per round per casting of the spell, regardless of how many times it enters the vortex’s space during that round. Finally, whenever a creature within medium range of the vortex casts a spell, roll a d6 and consult the following table. 1: A pulse of energy spreads 1d6 yards out from the vortex and dissipates. Everything in the area of the pulse and outside the space of the vortex must get a success on an Agility challenge roll or take 2d6 damage. 2: The vortex moves 1d6 yards toward the triggering creature. 3: Nothing happens. 4: The vortex moves 1d6 yards away from the triggering creature. 5: The vortex adds 1d3 yards to its radius. 6: A pulse of energy spreads 2d6 yards out from the vortex and dissipates.

On a 2, nothing else happens. On a 3, the target gains a +1d3 bonus to the score. A bonus cannot increase an attribute score above 20 or reduce it below 1. Bonuses and penalties last until the spell ends. They do not, however, modify the target’s characteristics.

The wall emits light out to a range of 20 yards. If you concentrate for the full minute, the wall remains for 1 additional hour without requiring your attention. Any object in the wall’s space that is not a relic takes damage equal to its Health and disappears. For any creature in the wall’s space when it appears or that enters it, roll a d6 and consult the following table. A creature can be affected by the wall only once per round per casting of this spell, regardless of how many times it enters the wall’s space. 1: Nothing happens. 2: The creature must make a Perception challenge roll with 1 bane.

The matter can take any shape you choose, though it cannot have moving parts.

CONJURE CONVEYANCE`OCCULT PHILOSOPHY`CONJURATION`UTILITY`5`Area: A cube of space, 10 yards on a side, originating from a point within medium range. Duration: 12 hours; see the effect. A vehicle appears on a solid or liquid surface inside the area. If you chose a solid surface, the vehicle is a carriage drawn by a team of four horses (Shadow, page 242). If you chose a liquid surface, the vehicle is a boat. The vehicle remains for the duration or until it’s destroyed, at which point the vehicle disappears in a cloud of sparkles. Either vehicle is a Size 6 object with Health 100, able to hold creatures and objects whose total Size does not exceed 20. Its maximum Speed is 20 (acceleration 4/deceleration 2) in combat or 30 miles per hour out of combat.

PASSAGE`OCCULT PHILOSOPHY`CONJURATION`UTILITY`5`Target: A point on a solid or liquid surface within long range. Duration: 1 hour. You open a space into the surface that contains the target.

SIMULACRUM`OCCULT PHILOSOPHY`CONJURATION`UTILITY`6`Requirement: You must have a silver mirror worth 1 gc. Area: A cube of space, large enough to accommodate a creature of your Size, originating from a point you can reach. Duration: See the effect. The mirror disappears, and a naked copy of yourself appears inside the area. Your consciousness moves into the copy’s body, where it remains until the body becomes incapacitated, which ends the spell and causes the copy to disappear into a cloud of sparkles. The copy’s body uses all your attributes and characteristics, except for its Health, which is half your normal Health score. The copy does not, however, start with any damage that your real body has. The copy can fully make use of any of your talents and traits and has full access to the spells you have learned. In effect, you create a second you (without, of course, your clothing and other possessions.) For as long as your consciousness occupies the copy’s body, your original body is unconscious. Provided you are within 1 mile of your original body, you can use an action to move your consciousness from your copy to your original body or vice versa. The body that your consciousness leaves becomes unconscious until you return to it. When your consciousness moves in this way, you become defenseless for 1 minute. When you transfer your consciousness, you leave behind any damage taken and marks of darkness gained by the body, but you bring with you Insanity, Corruption, and any remaining unexpended castings. If your consciousness occupies your copy’s body and the body dies, your consciousness travels back unerringly to your original body or the nearest other copy. Your disembodied consciousness travels at 10 miles per hour. It cannot use actions, does not perceive its surroundings, is immune to all damage and effects, and can move through solid objects. For each hour your consciousness remains outside a body, you gain 1 Insanity. If the gain would cause you to go mad, your consciousness shatters and never returns to the unconscious body. If your original body dies, the copy occupied by your consciousness becomes your new, permanent body. You are impaired while your consciousness occupies a copy of your body and is within short range of another copy of your body. When you finish casting the spell, you must get a success on a Will challenge roll with 3 banes or gain 1d3 Insanity. Sacrifice: You can use an action and expend a casting of this spell to allow your copy to heal all damage.`

Appearing inside the area are eight veterans (Shadow, page 262). They remain in existence for the duration. If a veteran conjured by this spell becomes incapacitated, it disappears. The veterans can have any appearance you choose. Friendly to you, they obey your spoken commands, even if doing so would be suicidal. On your turn, you can use a triggered action to briefly perceive from the space occupied by a veteran, provided you are within 1 mile of the creature. While you perceive from its space, you can issue it a command. Your senses return to your body when you finish your turn.`

The fortress is made of stone and consists of three turrets connected by three walls, creating a triangular space between them. Inside stands a keep, a stable, and a workshop. You decide the exact dimensions of the components of the structure, but no components can extend beyond the area. You can place as many doors and windows as you like throughout the structure and can divide the keep into as many floors and rooms as you wish. You can also designate a room’s function, which causes the room to become furnished appropriately for the function you assigned it. For example, a bedroom would have a bed, table, candles, and fireplace, while a dining hall would have tables and chairs. You can also add decorations and other cosmetic details. The fortress provides food and drink of whatever sort you wish enough to accommodate one hundred people. In addition, for every five creatures inside the fortress, the structure also creates a faceless servant (see page 136) that obeys your spoken commands or the spoken commands of any creature to which it is assigned. Aftereffect: Make a Strength challenge roll with 4 banes. On a success, you become fatigued until you complete a rest. If you’re already fatigued, take a –3d6 penalty to Health instead. On a failure, you take a penalty to your Health equal to half your Health that remains for 1 week and 1 day. If the total of your roll is 0 or lower, you take a penalty to your Health equal to your Health score and you die. Sacrifice: You can use an action and expend a casting of this spell to extend the duration by another 24 hours. Permanence: You must extend the spell’s duration each day for 1 year and 1 day.`

Aftereffect: Gain 1d6 Insanity, and then make a Strength challenge roll with 5 banes. On a failure, you take 10d6 damage. In addition, you take a –1d6 penalty to Power and become fatigued for 1 week and 1 day.

REINCARNATION`OCCULT PHILOSOPHY`NATURE`UTILITY`5`Target: The spirit of one dead creature residing in the Underworld or Hell. You name the spirit.

The spirit of a creature with a Corruption score of 6 or higher cannot be affected by this spell. On a success, the spirit appears in an open space within short range. Once the spirit appears, you must concentrate for 8 hours, during which time you fashion a new body for the creature from mud, sticks, and other natural materials. When you finish, the body becomes that of a human, dwarf, halfling, or some other mortal creature that does not have the Powerful Ancestry trait. The spirit then enters that body, causing it to come to life. You make all decisions about the new body, including its appearance and apparent age. The body has average scores for its Strength and Agility and has the spirit’s Intellect and Will scores. If the spirit is that of a late member of the group, it returns with all the benefits from its path choices and the group’s level. The character starts with the new ancestry’s attribute scores and then increases them as directed by his or her previously chosen paths. If the spirit belonged to someone else, it has the talents, spells, and other qualities that the individual had in life (at the GM’s discretion). Once the spirit takes residence in the new body, the creature must get a success on a Will challenge roll with 3 banes or gain 1d6 Insanity. Aftereffect: You must make a Strength challenge roll with 2 banes. On a failure, you gain 1d6 Insanity and become fatigued until you complete a rest.

The season to which you become attuned confers certain benefits: Autumn: Your hair, if any, becomes a riot of red and gold as you embrace autumn. While attuned to this season, you cannot be charmed, compelled, dazed, or stunned. If you had these afflictions, they become suppressed until the spell ends or until you change seasons. In addition, you can use an action to touch a creature and grant that creature a +5 bonus to Health that lasts until you switch seasons or the spell ends.

Otherwise, you might offer a gift or a service to the leshy in return for its assistance. Of course, if you suggest a course of activity the leshy finds offensive, it becomes hostile and attacks you and your companions. If the leshy agrees to serve, it accompanies you for the duration, though it remains under the GM’s control. While in your service, the leshy cannot use its Awaken the Forest special action, and its attacks deal 2d6 extra damage. If the leshy dies, the spell ends, and it returns to the earth whence it came.

On a failure, the incarnation is free to act as it chooses. The incarnation is hostile to all creatures other than animals and plants. If not compelled, it takes the next available turn to attack the nearest creature that it perceives as a threat.

SHED THE MORTAL COIL`OCCULT PHILOSOPHY`NECROMANCY`UTILITY`7`Requirement: You must have a soul. Duration: See the effect. Upon casting this spell, you must concentrate for 1 minute. When you finish, your body falls prone, and your soul climbs free from the flesh. You control your soul as if it were your body, while your body counts as being asleep. The spell ends when your soul moves back into the space occupied by your body. For the duration, your soul is equivalent to you, and you have the following benefits and drawbacks: Darksight: You gain darksight if you do not have it already. Darksight lets you see into areas within medium range that are obscured by shadows and darkness as if those areas were lit and into areas beyond this distance that are obscured by darkness as if those areas were obscured by shadows. Invisible: You are invisible to all creatures other than spirits, animals, and children. Strength: You lack a Strength score, which makes you immune to attacks against your Strength or effects that require a Strength roll. You cannot, however, interact with physical objects. Health: Any damage sustained by your body or your soul is counted against your Health score. Insubstantial: You take half damage from weapons, you can move through solid objects and through other creatures, and you ignore the effects of moving across difficult terrain. Possess Corpse: If you move into a space occupied by a corpse, you can possess it. You and the corpse combine to become a zombie (Shadow, page 259) until you use an action to leave the corpse, at which point it becomes an ordinary corpse once more. If the zombie becomes incapacitated, your soul is forced out, and you cannot possess that corpse again. Possess the Living: You can use an action to attempt to possess one creature you can reach that has a soul. Make an Intellect attack roll against the creature’s Will. On a success, your soul moves into the creature’s body. For as long as you possess the creature, you retain your Intellect, Will, and Health, languages, professions, and all of your talents from paths and spells, but you gain the traits of the creature’s ancestry. In addition, you replace the creature’s personality with your own. While possessing a creature, you can use an action to attempt to draw memories and experience from the hostage soul. Make an Intellect challenge roll. On a success, you can ask the soul a question and receive a true answer. You can use an action to abandon the body and return to your soul state. Alternatively, if the body dies while your soul inhabits it, you can either use the possess corpse option or move out of the body. Incapacitated: If you become incapacitated while under the effect of this spell, roll a d6. On a 4 or higher, your soul returns to your body. On a 3 or lower, your body dies, and your soul becomes a shadow (Shadow, page 253), retaining none of the statistics you had in life. Either way, the spell ends. Aftereffect: You must get a success on a Will challenge roll with 3 banes or gain 3d6 Insanity. Sacrifice: You can use an action and expend a casting of this spell to cast the awaken graveyard spell (previous page).`

The ground in the area trembles and shakes as a number of corpses dig their way free and stand up. This spell creates an army of 1d6 x 100 compelled animated corpses (Shadow, page 218). The army counts as one undead creature for the purpose of determining how many undead you can have compelled. Aftereffect: You must get a success on a Will challenge roll with 4 banes or gain 4d6 Insanity. In addition, you cannot cast this spell again until each creature created by this spell is destroyed.

The dark energies suffusing the place keep the dead from moving on. When a mortal creature dies in the area, its soul emerges from its body but is prevented from moving to the Underworld or Hell. Roll a d6. The soul becomes an apparition (see page 135) on a 1–5 or a phantom (Shadow, page 250) on a 6. In addition, the necromantic energies cause the new corpse to stand up and become undead 1d6 minutes after death. Roll a d6. The corpse becomes an animated corpse (Shadow, page 217) on a 1–5 or a zombie (Shadow, page 259) on a 6. Spirits and undead created by this spell are friendly to you and obey your spoken commands, though they are not compelled.

When you use an action to concentrate on this spell, you can move the area up to 5 yards. When you cast the spell, and again when you use an action to concentrate on it, the tendrils curl around creatures inside the area, drawing vitality from them. Each creature in the area must make a Strength challenge roll with 1 bane. When a creature gets a failure on this roll, it takes a –10 penalty to its Health, which worsens by 10 with each subsequent failure. The penalty lasts until the spell ends.

While you are in the area of darkness created by this spell, whenever you cast a Shadow attack spell, you make the attack roll with 3 boons and you impose 3 banes on challenge rolls made to resist such a spell.

SHADOW GATE`OCCULT PHILOSOPHY`SHADOW`UTILITY`7`Target: A point in space you can reach. Duration: 8 hours. A black speck appears at the target and then enlarges vertically until it becomes a 3-yard-radius black disk that remains in place for the duration. This shadow gate disappears when viewed from the side and totally obscures everything behind it. Anything that moves through the gate enters a shadow realm, which exists in the narrow gap between reality and the Void, and remains there until the spell ends, at which point the creature is shunted back into reality in an open space of the GM’s choice within 5 yards of the gate. The realm beyond the gate appears exactly like the normal world, except that all is rendered in black and white. Travelers through the gate find structures as they appear in the real world and see creatures in reality as if they were smoky and insubstantial. Creatures in reality cannot be affected in any way by creatures in this shadow realm and vice versa. Sounds emanating from these shadow projections are not audible more than 1 yard from the creatures that make them, and even up close they sound dull and muted. A creature that travels through this shadow realm moves at five times the normal rate, such that travelers can cover 15 miles per hour of walking or 40 miles per hour of running. Although no creatures are native to this border realm, travelers can sometimes see demons flitting about on the periphery of their vision, offering shocking displays of horrific beings eager to gain entry into the world. At any time before the spell ends, you can use an action to create an exit from the shadow realm, which takes the form of a 5-yard-radius white disk that remains in place until the spell ends. Any creature that passes through this exit returns to reality. Any creatures in the shadow realm when the spell ends become shunted into the Void, and most likely are never seen again.`

Any Size 1 or smaller creature or object that enters the area takes damage equal to its Health and disappears. A Size 2 or 3 creature that enters the area takes damage equal to half its Health, and the part of its body that came in contact with the area disappears. A larger creature can avoid coming into contact with the area by getting a success on an Agility challenge roll as it moves through it. The area erases portions of Size 2 or larger objects that encounter it, such that the spell could annihilate a section of wall or part of a large statue.

Area: A cylinder with a 10-mile radius that reaches up to the sky, centered on a point on the ground you can reach. Duration: 3d6 days. When you finish concentrating, the air temperature plunges to far below freezing. Dark clouds gather overhead, blotting out the sun, and release heavy snow to fall to the ground in the area, causing 1d3 + 2 feet of snow to accumulate each day until the spell ends. The blizzard conditions totally obscure the area, and all surfaces covered in snow are difficult terrain. The strong winds prevent flying and attacking with ranged weapons that do not use bullets. Exposed creatures in the area that are not wearing some sort of protective clothing take 1d6 damage at the end of each round.

HURRICANE`OCCULT PHILOSOPHY`STORM`UTILITY`10`Requirement: You must be able to see the sky and concentrate for 1 hour. Target: A point in the sky that you can see. Duration: 3d6 hours. When you finish concentrating, a rotating mass of black, seething clouds spill out from the target until they reach a 200-mile radius, at which point the mass becomes a hurricane. The storm moves 50 miles per hour in a direction you choose. Heavy rain (or snow, depending on the current air temperature) falls on the ground below the clouds for the duration. The falling precipitation heavily obscures the area below the hurricane. Severe winds of up to 175 miles per hour savage the area under the clouds. Attack rolls made using thrown or ranged weapons automatically result in failures. Attack rolls made using siege weapons are made with 5 banes. Flying creatures and vehicles are blown about and fall. Given the scope of this spell’s effects, much is left to the GM to describe; the hurricane flattens structures, causes widespread flooding, uproots trees, tosses unsecured objects about, and generally wreaks havoc until the storm subsides. The storm’s severity also means that some significant loss of life is likely—people might drown, be caught in collapsed buildings, or be struck by flying debris. Again, the GM decides exactly what happens based on where the storm strikes. Creatures in the storm must contend with the winds. At the end of each round, an unprotected creature in the area must make a Strength challenge roll. A Size 1 or smaller creature makes the roll with 3 banes. On a failure, a creature cannot move against the wind; in addition, Size 1 and smaller creatures fall prone and are moved 3d6 yards in the direction the wind is blowing. Also at the end of the round, flying debris might strike creatures in your vicinity. Assume that 1d6 pieces of debris fly into the area at randomly determined creatures. A creature threatened by flying debris must get a success on an Agility challenge roll or take 4d6 damage and fall prone. Aftereffect: You must get a success on a Will challenge roll with 5 banes, or you gain 3d6 Insanity and take 10d6 damage. If you are incapacitated by this damage, you explode and die. You must wait at least 1 year and 1 day before you can cast this spell again.`

You can ask for anything you can imagine; however, the GM decides whether your patron delivers or not, as well as exactly how the god or gods fulfill your request. The GM is encouraged to permit reasonable requests. Examples might include causing a bridge to suddenly appear to span a chasm or parting the waters of a sea. Unreasonable requests (unlimited wishes, ownership of an eternal empire, extinguishing the sun) might lead to nothing happening at all or the patron answering the request in a way that is as detrimental as it might be helpful. Aftereffect You must make a Strength challenge roll with 4 banes and a Will challenge roll with 4 banes. If you get a failure on the Strength challenge roll, you take damage equal to your Health. If you get a failure on the Will challenge roll, you gain Insanity equal to your Will, and when you roll to end the effects of the resulting madness, you must roll twice and use the lower result.`
APOCALYPSE`OCCULT PHILOSOPHY`THEURGY`UTILITY`10`Area: A 200-mile-radius sphere centered on a point you can reach. Duration: Concentration, up to seven days. You doom everything in the area to face up to seven apocalyptic events. Each creature in the area when you cast the spell or that enters it cannot leave the area until the spell ends. Once every 24 hours until the spell ends, you apply one of the following apocalyptic events, starting with Rapture and ending with Ruin, to everything in the area. Note that while concentrating on this spell, you might be subject to the effects of sleep deprivation (Shadow, page 200). Rapture: Darkness blots out the moon and stars above the area as the sound of trumpets blares loud enough to reach the ears of peoples of all nations and lands. Each creature in the area that has a Health score of 10 or lower and that has 0 Corruption takes damage equal to its Health. Any creature that has a Health score greater than 10 and has 0 Corruption must get a success on a Will challenge roll or take damage equal to its Health. If a creature chooses to gain 1 Corruption, it gets an automatic success on this roll. Famine: The sun turns black for the spell’s duration, and the trumpets sound for a second time. All food in the area spoils and becomes inedible. The remains of any once-living creature of flesh and blood in the area immediately putrefies and becomes inedible. Plague: The trumpets sound a third time as a vile disease sweeps through the area. Each creature in it becomes diseased until the spell ends. When a creature is diseased by this spell, foul blisters and buboes appear all over its body, and its breath reeks of death. Meteor Showers: The trumpets sound a fourth time, calling down stars to fall from the heavens, each leaving a multicolored trail behind it as it burns up. Choose five points in the area. A large meteor strikes each point, exploding in a 1,000-yard radius on impact. The explosion deals 10d6 damage to everything in the area. A creature in the area must make a Strength challenge roll with 2 banes. It also becomes poisoned until the spell ends on a failure, or just takes half the damage on a success. War: The trumpets sound for a fifth time to herald the onset of war. Each creature in the area that has a Health score of 20 or lower gains Insanity equal to its Will score. Any creature that has a Health score greater than 20 can make a Will challenge roll with 2 banes. On a failure, it gains Insanity equal to its Will score. A creature driven mad by this effect does not roll on the Madness table (Shadow, page 35). Instead, the creature automatically suffers the violence result, and the creature cannot end this madness until the spell ends. Death: The sounding of the trumpets for the sixth time invites Death to stalk the area. One out of every four creatures in the area takes damage equal to its Health. The GM decides which creatures die. Ruin: The trumpets sound for the seventh and final time, causing each structure in the area to take damage equal to its Health. Any creature inside a structure takes an amount of damage equal to 1d6 x the structure’s Size. A creature that would take this damage can make a Strength challenge roll with 2 banes and takes half the damage on a success. In addition, all natural plants in the area wither and die. All waters in the area turn to blood. And nothing planted in these lands for the next 5d20 years will grow. Aftereffect: When the spell ends, all ongoing magical effects on you end, and you take damage equal to your Health. Your soul, if you have one, travels to your patron deity, where you must offer reasons for the casting of this spell. If you were justified, your soul goes to Elysium (see Terrible Beauty), where it remains until the end of time. If your actions are judged to be not justified, you gain 20 Corruption and your soul sinks to Hell, where you enjoy the attentions of Diabolus himself for all time.`
CONSEQUENCE`OCCULT PHILOSOPHY`TIME`UTILITY`0`Triggered: When you would make an attack roll or a challenge roll, you can use a triggered action to look ahead and see the consequence of your effort. You then make the triggering roll with 1d3 boons. If the roll results in a failure, you become dazed for 1 round.`
RETRY`OCCULT PHILOSOPHY`TIME`UTILITY`0`Triggered: When the result of an attack roll or a challenge roll made by a creature within short range is a success or a failure, you can use a triggered action to cast this spell. You create a ripple in time, which causes the creature to discard the result of the triggering roll and roll again. Aftereffect: You must make a Will challenge roll. On a failure, the next time you make an attack roll or a challenge roll before the end of the next round, you must discard the result and roll again.`
BORROWED TIME`OCCULT PHILOSOPHY`TIME`UTILITY`1`Triggered: When you take a turn, you can use a triggered action to cast this spell. For 1 minute, you increase the number of actions you can use on your turn by one, and you gain a bonus to Speed equal to your Speed score. At the end of each round until the effect ends, you must get a success on a Will challenge roll or you become stunned for 1 round. You cannot voluntarily end this effect once you have cast the spell.`
TIME LOOP`OCCULT PHILOSOPHY`TIME`ATTACK`1`Target: One creature you can see within short range. You attempt to trap the target in a short-lived time loop. Make an Intellect attack roll against the target’s Will. On a success, the target becomes trapped in a time loop for 1 minute. When trapped in this way, the target must repeat what it did on its previous turn. If the target took a fast turn or a slow turn, it must take a fast turn or a slow turn each round until the effect ends. If the target used an action during its previous turn, it must use an action to perform the same task each round until the effect ends. If the task was an attack, the target must attack the same target and use the same weapon. If it cannot reach the target, it instead attacks the space closest to it that it can reach. If the task was a spell, the target must cast the same spell against the same target or area. If the target runs out of castings, it attempts to cast the spell and fails. At the end of each round, the target can make a Will challenge roll with 1 bane and ends the effect on itself with a success.`
TIME SKIP`OCCULT PHILOSOPHY`TIME`UTILITY`2`Duration: 1 minute. You destabilize your timeline and rapidly jump from the present into the future and back again for the duration. You appear to flicker in and out of existence, with echoes of your past selves appearing around you and then vanishing. Until the spell ends, you impose 2 banes on attack rolls made against you, and you make attack rolls with 2 boons. Aftereffect: Make a Strength challenge roll with 1 bane. On a failure, roll a d6. On an odd number, you appear to grow a bit younger. On an even number, you appear to grow a bit older.`
TIMELY WARNING`OCCULT PHILOSOPHY`TIME`UTILITY`2`Triggered: When a creature within medium range that you can see would take damage or gain an affliction, you can use a triggered action to cast this spell. You mark in your mind the exact moment when this event occurred, and then your future self from a few moments ahead in time travels back to just before the event to deliver a warning to the triggering creature. The creature reduces the damage it would have taken to 0 or removes the affliction it would have gained. At the end of each round thereafter, you must make a Will challenge roll with 1 bane. On a failure, you transport yourself back in time to deliver the warning, disappearing and reappearing in the space you occupied 1 round later, which ends the spell. If you become incapacitated before you can deliver the warning, you and the triggering creature each gain 1d6 Insanity as time momentarily unravels.`
HALT TIME`OCCULT PHILOSOPHY`TIME`UTILITY`3`Area: A 4-yard-radius sphere centered on a point you can reach. Duration: 1 minute; see the effect. Time halts in the area for the duration. Each creature other than you in the area becomes insensate, unable to use actions or triggered actions, and unable to move. Creatures outside the area cannot enter it, and objects or effects originating from outside the area cannot reach into the area; they stop at its edge, remaining there until the spell ends. Creatures and objects in the area cannot be attacked, moved, or affected by any effect. Ongoing effects that apply to creatures and objects in the area are suspended until the spell ends. You, however, are unaffected by the spell and can freely move around in the area, leave it, and return to it. You can end the effect at any time without using an action to do so. Once the spell ends, time moves faster in the area it affected until it resumes the normal flow of time. Two rounds pass inside the sphere for every round that elapses outside it until time again flows the same in both places. If the spell lasted for three rounds, for instance, then the accelerated time lasts for three rounds. Each of the extra rounds that elapses inside the sphere occurs between each pair of rounds that elapse outside it. Any creature in the sphere during one of these extra rounds can take a turn. But if a creature leaves the sphere on its turn during one of these extra rounds, the creature enters normal time, and its turn immediately ends as it does so. Such a creature must get a success on a Will challenge roll or gain 1 Insanity. Attacks and other effects originating from inside the sphere that would affect targets or areas outside it are resolved at the end of the extra round. In addition, creatures inside the area make attack rolls against targets outside the sphere with 3 boons, while targets outside the sphere make challenge rolls to resist harmful effects with 3 banes.`
MAJOR PARADOX`OCCULT PHILOSOPHY`TIME`ATTACK`3`Target: Up to five creatures you can see within medium range. You attempt to knot each target’s timeline so that the creature does not exist in the present. Each target must get a success on an Intellect challenge roll with 1 bane or disappear, removed from existence for 1 minute. While removed from existence, the target is insensate, cannot use actions or triggered actions, and cannot move. When the effect ends for a target, it returns to the space from which it disappeared or the nearest open space of its choice.`
EXCELLENT ADVENTURE`OCCULT PHILOSOPHY`TIME`UTILITY`4`Describe a simple activity you could have reasonably performed in the space within 10 yards of you at some point within the last hour. The activity could be hiding a key under a rock, placing poison in a cup, sticking a disguise in a nearby closet, or something similar, provided the activity does not involve directly harming a creature or an object. The result of the activity then becomes real, just as if you had in fact performed it: the key is under the stone, or the cup now contains poison. If you are still alive when the adventure ends, you instantly travel back through time to a point up to an hour before you cast this spell and carry out the activity. When you finish, you disappear and return to your normal place in time. If you are unable to complete the activity, either because you died or you were unable to do what you said you would do, you create a paradox, since you are not able to go back in time and perform the activity you described. As a result of your failure to close this loop in the time stream, the outcome of some event or situation that you and members of your group were involved in changes, at the GM’s discretion.`
STOLEN MOMENTS`OCCULT PHILOSOPHY`TIME`ATTACK`4`Target: Up to two creatures you can see within medium range. You attempt to steal time from each target and bestow that time on other creatures you choose. For each target, make an Intellect attack roll against its Will. On a success, the target cannot take a turn for 1 minute and is defenseless. While defenseless, the target is also immobilized. The effect immediately ends if the target takes any damage. The target can make a Will challenge roll at the end of each round and ends the effect on itself on a success. For each target affected by this spell, choose a creature you can see within short range. Each creature you choose can take an extra turn each round until the effect ends on the target whose turns are being stolen.`
ALTER FORTUNES`OCCULT PHILOSOPHY`TIME`UTILITY`5`Triggered: At the end of the round, you can use a triggered action to cast this spell. You disappear, removed from time. During the next round, whenever a creature within a number of yards from the space you left equal to half your Speed would make an attack roll or a challenge roll, you can turn the result of the roll into a success or a failure, by moving between the moments to meddle with what happens. You can use this effect up to three times during the round. At the end of the round, you reappear in an open space within a number of yards from the space you left equal to your Speed. Aftereffect: You must get a success on a Strength challenge roll with 2 banes or become fatigued for 1 hour.`
TIME DISRUPTION`OCCULT PHILOSOPHY`TIME`UTILITY`5`Area: A 10-yard-radius sphere centered on a point within medium range. Duration: 1 minute. You entangle the timelines of creatures in the area. Each creature in the area must make a Will challenge roll with 3 banes. On a failure, the creature gains 1d3 Insanity and becomes stunned for 1 minute. At the end of each round until the effect ends for a creature, it can repeat the Will challenge roll. On a success, the creature removes the stunned affliction from itself but can take only slow turns, either moving or using an action on each of its turns for the remainder of the spell’s duration.`
SEVER TIMELINE`OCCULT PHILOSOPHY`TIME`ATTACK`6`Target: One creature you can see within medium range. You reach across the target’s timeline, searching for the best place to cut. Make an Intellect attack roll against the target’s Will. If the target has a Health score of 50 or lower, you get an automatic success. If the target has a Health score of 100 or higher, you make the roll with 3 banes. On a success, you cut the target’s timeline, causing it to fade from reality for 1 minute. During this time, the target is impaired and slowed, its attacks deal half damage, and it takes half damage from all attacks. At the end of each round, the target must make a Will challenge roll with 3 banes. If the target gets three successes, the effect ends and the target’s timeline is restored. Otherwise, at the end of this time, the target disappears and its dead body appears prone in a space it previously occupied. Although the target’s death does not affect what happened since it died, anyone who encountered the target since then forgets having done so, and their minds fabricate other explanations for any influence the target might have had on them during that time.`
TIME DILATION`OCCULT PHILOSOPHY`TIME`UTILITY`6`Target: Up to five creatures you can see within short range. Duration: 1 minute. You speed up time for each target for the duration. Each target can take a fast turn and a slow turn, makes attack rolls and challenge rolls with 1 boon, and has a bonus to Speed equal to half its base Speed score. Aftereffect: Each target must make a Will challenge roll with 3 banes. On a failure, the target takes 2d6 damage and becomes fatigued for 1 minute. When fatigued in this way, the target is also slowed.`
TEMPORAL BUBBLE`OCCULT PHILOSOPHY`TIME`UTILITY`7`Area: A 5-yard-radius sphere centered on a point you can reach. Duration: 8 hours. You dislodge the area and everything in it from the time stream. For the duration, time passes normally in the area, but outside it, time passes at one-eighth the normal rate, such that when the spell ends, only 1 hour of actual time will have passed. The outside edge of the area ripples with temporal distortions, heavily obscuring everything behind it. Strong winds swirl around inside the area and within 5 yards of it. If a creature or object moves across the barrier, it takes 10d6 damage from the stress of entering a slower or faster timestream. A creature can make a Strength challenge roll with 2 banes and takes half the damage on a success.`
ERASE FROM EXISTENCE`OCCULT PHILOSOPHY`TIME`ATTACK`8`Choose one living creature of flesh and blood that you can see within medium range. You step backward in time to kill one of the creature’s ancestors. Make an Intellect challenge roll with 4 banes. If the total of your roll is 0 or lower, you are killed in the attempt, and your body lies dead somewhere in the past. On any other failure, you fail to kill the creature’s ancestor and return to the space you left with 2d6 damage and 1 Insanity. If you get a success on a roll of 19 or lower, you fail to kill the ancestor, but your attempt changed history enough that the chosen creature disappears from your location, having followed a different path in life. Finally, if the total of your challenge roll is 20 or higher, you kill the ancestor, and the chosen creature disappears entirely, having never been born. You return to the space you left, and you and each creature within 20 yards of you must make a Will challenge roll with 4 banes. On a failure, a creature gains 1d6 Insanity. In addition, you create shock waves through time as reality struggles to account for the changes you made. The GM decides the exact effects of reality’s change based on the nature of the chosen creature, its history, and its effects on the world; possibilities include certain people having never been born, changes to recent history, relocation of certain places, and so on. Aftereffect: You must make a Will challenge roll with 4 banes. On a failure, you gain Insanity equal to your Will, you forget this spell, and you cannot learn it or cast it again.`
STOP TIME`OCCULT PHILOSOPHY`TIME`UTILITY`9`Duration: 1d3 + 1 rounds.

A creature takes 9d6 damage on a failure from the trauma of time restarting, or half the damage on a success.`
TIME GATE`OCCULT PHILOSOPHY`TIME`UTILITY`10`Area: A cube of space, 2 yards on a side, originating from a point you can reach. Light bends and warps inside the area. Upon casting the spell, you must concentrate for 1 hour, during which time you fix your mind on a specific time in the past or the future. At the end of every 10 minutes you spend concentrating, you must make a Strength challenge roll with 1 bane, taking 1d6 damage and gaining 1 Insanity on a failure. If you concentrate for the full hour, a portal opens inside the area and remains open for 10 minutes, after which time it closes. The portal has a front and a back, but does not have sides. Peering through the portal reveals the same area affected by the spell as it appears at the past or future time you specified. You and any creatures from your time can pass through the portal in either direction for as long as it remains open. When you pass through the portal, you remain in the same location, but at the time you specified. Aftereffect You must make a Will challenge roll with 5 banes. On a failure, you gain Insanity equal to your Will score.`

You take control of all the water in the area for the duration. Choose one of the following effects. Divide the Waters: You separate the waters in the area to create a line of open space 10 yards tall, 20 yards wide, and 100 yards long.

When the spell ends, the water slowly flows back into the area until it reaches its previous level again. Raise the Waters: You raise the surface of the water up to 20 yards. Water raised in this way might cause flooding, wash away a bridge, or capsize a vessel floating on the surface at the GM’s discretion. Lower the Waters: You lower the surface of the water by as much as 20 yards. If the area is fully enclosed by a large body of water, this effect crates a whirlpool that lasts until the spell ends. Any vehicle floating on the surface of the body of water is pulled into the whirlpool and takes 1d6 damage at the end of each round. A pilot can keep a vehicle from being pulled into the whirlpool by getting a success on an Agility challenge roll with 3 banes.`
SEETHING SEA`OCCULT PHILOSOPHY`WATER`ATTACK`6`Target: A cube of water, 100 yards on a side, originating from a point within short range. Duration: 1 minute.

A creature that would become trapped can make an Agility challenge roll. On a success, it is not trapped and appears on the surface of the ice. A creature trapped in the ice is defenseless. When defenseless in this way, a creature is immobilized and takes 2d6 damage from cold at the end of each round. A trapped creature can attempt to break free from the ice by using an action to make a Strength challenge roll with 3 banes. Each success deals 1d6 damage to the 2-yard cube of ice in which it is trapped. The ice remains for the duration, though fire created by a rank 7 or higher spell can melt ice in each of its areas. Each 2-yard cube of ice has Defense 5 and Health 30.`
BECOME THE SEA`OCCULT PHILOSOPHY`WATER`UTILITY`8`Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour. You assume the form of a Size 3 wall of water and remain in that form for the duration. You resume your normal form when the spell ends, appearing anywhere in the wall’s space. When you are in watery form, you gain the following benefits and drawbacks. Sightless: You rely on senses other than sight to perceive your surroundings, and you can pinpoint the location of each creature and object within long range of you. Creatures within that area cannot hide from you, and you ignore banes imposed by obscurement on rolls to perceive things. You are not subject to the blinded condition. Immune: damage from acid, disease, and poison; blinded, dazed, deafened, diseased, fatigued, frightened, immobilized, poisoned, prone, slowed, stunned, and any effect that would change your shape. Watery Form: You take half damage from weapons. Frozen Form: When you take damage from cold, you gain a +1d6 bonus to Defense and you halve your Speed. This effect lasts for 1 round or until you take damage from fire. Fire Vulnerability: You make challenge rolls to resist Fire attack spells with 1 bane, and you take double damage from Fire spells. Amorphous: You can move freely through openings wide enough to permit the passage of water, and you can move through spaces occupied by other creatures. Empowered by Water: When you would take damage from a Water spell, you instead add the damage as a bonus to your Health. The bonus lasts for 1 minute. Tidal Forces: When you use an action to concentrate on this spell, each creature within medium range must make a Strength challenge roll. A creature floating or submerged in liquid makes the roll with 2 banes. On a failure, a creature is moved 1d6 yards away from you if it is within 10 yards of you, or 2d6 yards toward you if it is more than 10 yards from you. If a creature encounters an obstacle before moving the full distance, it takes 1 damage for each yard it was prevented from moving in this way. Crashing Wave: On your turn, you can use a triggered action to smash one creature or object within 3 yards of you. Make a Will attack roll with 1 boon against the target’s Agility. If the target is in contact with a liquid, you make the roll with 3 boons instead of 1. On a success, the target takes 5d6 damage and must get a success on a Strength challenge roll or fall prone.`
NAME OF WATER`OCCULT PHILOSOPHY`WATER`UTILITY`9`Duration: 1 hour. You speak the secret name of water and master its power. For the duration, you can cast Water spells of rank 3 and lower that you have learned without expending castings of them. In addition, you can cast any rank 0 Water spell, whether you have learned it or not.`
TSUNAMI`OCCULT PHILOSOPHY`WATER`ATTACK`10`Requirement: You must be able to see a body of water large enough to accommodate the spell’s area. Area: A line of water, 5 miles long and 1/2 mile wide, originating from a point you can see. Duration: See the effect. The water in the area rises up until it becomes a 2,000-foothigh wave. The wave moves in a direction you choose until it makes landfall. When moving across waters at least 4 miles in depth, the wave moves 500 miles per hour. In shallower waters, the wave moves 100 miles per hour. Anything in the wave’s path becomes picked up by it and moves with it unless it has some reasonable method to escape, such as flying away or using Teleportation magic. When the wave hits land, it crashes, dealing 20d6 damage to everything along its length within 100 yards of the shore as well as to whatever it picked up along the way. Everything beyond 100 yards out to 500 yards away from the shore takes 10d6 damage, and everything beyond 500 yards out to 1,000 yards away from the shore takes 5d6 damage. A creature in any of these affected areas can make a Strength challenge roll with 3 banes, taking half the damage on a success. Ships and other waterborne vessels take double damage from this spell. The exact effects of the wave are up to the GM, but one can expect widespread flooding, destruction of structures, and significant changes to the shoreline. Aftereffect: You must make a Strength challenge roll with 5 banes. You take 10d6 damage on a failure, or half the damage on a success.`
