PRESERVATION`OCCULT PHILOSOPHY`ALCHEMY`UTILITY`0`Requirement: You must have an alchemist’s kit. Target: One Size 1 or smaller object you can reach. Duration: 10 days. You whip up a special ointment from your alchemist’s kit and smear it on the target. For the duration, the target will not rot, decay, or spoil. The target takes half damage from all sources. If the target is something that can be worn, the protective quality applies to the object and not the wearer— smearing the substance on a suit of plate and mail armor would impart all the qualities to the armor, but the wearer would still take damage as normal. If you smear the substance on a clockwork in object form, the clockwork remains protected by the spell until it returns to its creature form or until the spell ends. Finally, if the target is a corpse, the magic prevents it from being turned into undead.`
VENOMOUS DART`OCCULT PHILOSOPHY`ALCHEMY`UTILITY`0`Requirement: You must have an alchemist’s kit and at least one dart. Duration: Until you complete a rest. Upon casting this spell, you must concentrate for 1 minute, during which time you use your alchemist’s kit to concoct a special poison and apply it to as many as five darts. When you finish, each dart you applied poison to becomes imbued with magic that lasts for the duration or until it is used to make an attack. A creature holding a dart can attack with it, and makes the attack roll with 1 boon. A creature hit by a dart must get a success on a Strength challenge roll or take 1d3 + 1 damage from the dart’s poison and become poisoned for 1 minute.`
FIRE BOTTLE`OCCULT PHILOSOPHY`ALCHEMY`UTILITY`1`Requirement: You must have an alchemist’s kit. Target: Up to three small, empty containers, capable of holding liquid, that you can reach. Duration: Until you complete a rest; see the effect. Upon casting this spell, you must concentrate for 1 minute, during which time you mix up a volatile substance from your alchemist’s kit. When you finish, you fill each container with the substance, which retains potency for the duration or until the bottle is used. A creature holding the container can use an action to throw it at a point within short range. If the point is on a creature, the thrower must get a success on an Agility attack roll against the creature’s Agility. Otherwise, the bottle lands at a point within 1d3 yards of the creature in a direction of the GM’s choosing. When the bottle strikes a solid surface, the container breaks and the substance inside explodes in a 2-yard radius centered on the point of impact. The flames from the explosion deal 1d6 damage to everything in that area. Combustible objects that take this damage catch fire. A creature in the area of the explosion must make an Agility challenge roll, taking half the damage on a success, or catching fire on a failure. A creature that catches fire takes 1d6 damage from the flames at the end of each round until the fire is extinguished.`
REEKING FOG`OCCULT PHILOSOPHY`ALCHEMY`ATTACK`2`Target: A point within medium range. Duration: 1 minute. You toss a small bead of liquid at the target. If you chose a point on a creature, you must get a success on an Intellect attack roll against its Agility. Otherwise, the bead lands at a point within 1d3 yards of the creature in a direction the GM chooses. When the bead strikes a solid surface, it shatters, and the liquid inside becomes a foul-smelling fog that spreads out in a 5-yard radius centered on that point. The fog remains for the duration. It partially obscures the area, and any living, breathing creature in the area when it appears or that enters that area must make a Strength challenge roll with 1 bane. On a failure, the creature becomes impaired for as long as it remains in the fog and for 1 minute after. On a success, the creature becomes immune to the effects of the fog. A creature makes this roll just once per round, regardless of how many times it enters the fog.`
CORROSIVE TOUCH`OCCULT PHILOSOPHY`ALCHEMY`UTILITY`2`Duration: 1 minute. An orange, gelatinous substance covers your hand and remains for the duration. When you cast the spell and again whenever you use an action to do so, you can make an attack with an unarmed strike, substituting Intellect for the attribute you ordinarily use to make attacks with unarmed strikes. If you get a success against a creature or against an object made from organic materials such as wood, bone, or flesh, the target of the attack takes 2d6 extra damage from the corrosive substance on your hand.`
OIL SLICK`OCCULT PHILOSOPHY`ALCHEMY`ATTACK`2`Area: A circle with a 5-yard radius centered on a point on the ground within short range. Duration: 10 minutes. Oil rains down to cover every surface in the area. The oil is extremely slippery and the area counts as difficult terrain. Once per round when a creature moves across a surface in the area by a means other than crawling or tries to stand up in it, the creature must get a success on an Agility challenge roll with 3 banes or fall prone. Any creature that tries to pick up an object from out of the oil must get a success on an Agility challenge roll with 3 banes. On a failure, the object squirts out of the creature’s hand and lands 1d3 yards away in a random direction. The oil is flammable. If anything in the area takes fire damage, the entire area catches fire and burns for 1d6 minutes, filling the air with acrid smoke. The smoke heavily obscures the area, and any creature in the area that breathes it must get a success on a Strength challenge roll or take 1d6 damage. Furthermore, at the end of each round, the fire deals 1d6 damage to everything in its area. Once the fire burns out, the oil disappears.`
SPEW POISON`OCCULT PHILOSOPHY`ALCHEMY`ATTACK`3`Requirement: You must have an alchemist’s kit. Area: A 5-yard-long cone originating from a point in your space. You drink a dose of noxious fluids stored in your alchemist’s kit and then spray it from your mouth into the area. You take 1d6 damage from the poisonous substance, and each creature in the area must make a Strength challenge roll. A creature takes 4d6 damage from the poison and becomes poisoned for 1 hour on a failure, or just takes half the damage on a success.`
MANIKINS`OCCULT PHILOSOPHY`ALCHEMY`UTILITY`3`Requirement: You must have an alchemist’s kit. Target: A Size 1 block of clay. Duration: See the effect. Upon casting this spell, you must concentrate for up to 5 minutes. For each minute you spend in concentration, you shape one compelled tiny construct (see page 136) from the target. The construct remains until you cast this spell again or the manikin is destroyed. While at least one construct remains, you can use an action to perceive from the space of any active construct that is within long range. When you perceive from the construct’s space, you are blinded and deafened with respect to the space you occupy, but you can see and hear normally from the construct’s space. You can use a triggered action at any time to end this effect. Sacrifice: You can use an action and expend a casting of this spell to cause each manikin created by this spell to explode in a 1-yard radius centered on a point within the manikin’s space. The manikin takes damage equal to its Health, which destroys it, and everything in the area takes 1d6 + 1 damage from the flying debris. A creature can make an Agility challenge roll and takes half the damage on a success.`
BREW DRAGON FIRE`OCCULT PHILOSOPHY`ALCHEMY`UTILITY`4`Requirement: You must have an alchemist’s kit. Target: A small clay container, capable of holding liquid, that you can reach. Duration: Until you complete a rest; see the effect. Upon casting this spell, you must concentrate for 1 minute, during which time you mix ingredients from your alchemist’s kit. When you finish, you fill the target with a volatile substance that retains its potency for the duration or until it’s used. A creature holding the container can use an action to throw the bottle of dragon fire to a point within short range, where the container lands. If the thrower chooses a point on a creature, the thrower must get a success on an Agility attack roll against the creature’s Agility. The bottle hits the creature on a success; on a failure, it lands within 1d3 yards of the specified point in a direction the GM chooses. Upon striking a solid surface, the container breaks, releasing fiery goo that threatens to cover everything in a 4-yard radius hemisphere. A creature that gets a success on an Agility challenge roll avoids the goo. Anything covered in the dragon fire takes 2d6 damage and catches fire. A creature that catches fire takes 1d6 damage from the flames at the end of each round until the fire is extinguished. The flames from the substance last 1 minute, cannot be smothered by ordinary means, and burn even when submerged in liquid. A creature can use an action to scrape away the goo with an object, which then catches fire if it is flammable. Once dragon fire burns out, it leaves behind ordinary fire that can be extinguished using normal means.`
REANIMATE CORPSE`OCCULT PHILOSOPHY`ALCHEMY`UTILITY`4`Requirement: You must have an alchemist’s kit. Target: One Size 1 dead creature you can reach. Upon casting this spell, you must concentrate for 1 minute, during which time you use your kit to inject strange ingredients into the target’s body. When you finish, you return the creature to life with damage equal to its healing rate. Each time the target completes a rest, it must make a Will challenge roll with 3 banes. On a failure, it gains 1d6 Insanity and takes a –3 penalty to its Intellect score (minimum 0). If the target’s Intellect drops to 0, the target transforms into a hostile monster (Shadow, page 246) of its Size, retaining none of its original statistics, and taking the next available turn to attack. If the target gets three successes on the Will challenge rolls, it removes the penalty to Intellect and no longer has to make the Will challenge rolls.`
BEGET OOZE`OCCULT PHILOSOPHY`ALCHEMY`UTILITY`5`Area: A cube of space, 2 yards on a side, originating from a point within medium range. Duration: 1 minute. You fling a gelatinous droplet to a point on a solid surface inside the area. At the end of the round, the droplet expands to become a compelled Size 3 ooze (Shadow, page 249) that remains for the duration or until it’s destroyed.`
MONSTROUS TRANSFORMATION`OCCULT PHILOSOPHY`ALCHEMY`UTILITY`5`Requirement: You must have an alchemist’s kit. Target: A syringe or a small bottle, capable of holding liquid, that you can reach. Duration: 8 hours or until expended. Upon casting this spell, you must concentrate for 1 minute, during which time you mix ingredients to fill the target with a transformative substance that retains its potency for the duration. Any living creature holding a syringe that contains the substance can use an action to voluntarily inject the substance into itself or into another willing and living creature. Against an unwilling living creature, the creature holding the syringe must get a success on an Agility attack roll against the target’s Agility. If the substance is inside a bottle, a living creature holding it can use an action to consume it or to administer it to a defenseless or unconscious living creature. At the end of the round in which a creature is injected with or otherwise consumes the substance, it transforms into a huge monster (Shadow, page 246) with the frightening trait and remains in this form for 1 hour or until it becomes incapacitated. While in this form, the creature replaces its statistics with that of its new form. When the effect ends, the creature returns to its normal form and gains 1d3 Insanity.`
